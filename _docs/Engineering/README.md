Engineering Docs Taxonomy
=========================

This directory now groups engineering knowledge by the kind of decision it captures:

Architecture/
  Long-lived platform decisions, state management patterns, and data model references.

Experiments/
  Spikes, prototypes, and exploratory write-ups that may evolve into future work.

Integrations/
  Notes and API references for connecting Agipo to external systems, SDKs, or internal services.

References/
  Technical explainers and one-off deep dives that we reach for during implementation.

When adding a new document, pick the folder that matches the intent. If a note spans multiple areas, drop a short pointer in the most relevant folder and link out.
