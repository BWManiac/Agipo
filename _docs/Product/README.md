Product Docs Taxonomy
=====================

Content here is now grouped by the kind of narrative it supports:

Strategy/
  Vision, first principles, and durable product theses.

Positioning/
  Customer-facing stories, product overviews, and messaging drafts.

MVP/
  Execution plans, feature breakdowns, and validation tests for the initial release.

Notes/
  Scratchpads and working notes that do not yet harden into strategy or positioning.

YC/
  Materials prepared for Y Combinator programs and investor-facing storytelling.

When adding new docs, drop them into the folder that matches their purpose. If something spans buckets, link across folders instead of duplicating the source file.
