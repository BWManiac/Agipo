**Backend:** `app/api/workflows-c/`
- **661 lines** of code
- Services (code-generator, storage), API routes

**Total: 3,919 lines**

**Notes:**
- Power-user features (command palette)
- Code preview component
- Less complete than A

---

### Workflows D (`workflows-d/`)

**Frontend:** `app/(pages)/workflows-d/`
- **5,314 lines** of code
- Most lines of any frontend
- Undo/redo, chat panel, comprehensive components

**Backend:** `app/api/workflows-d/`
- **959 lines** of code
- Services (storage, types), API routes, chat integration

**Total: 6,273 lines**

**Notes:**
- Largest frontend implementation
- Undo/redo functionality
- Chat panel integration
- No code generator or execution service

---

### Workflows E (`workflows-e/`)

**Frontend:** `app/(pages)/workflows-e/`
- **2,215 lines** of code
- Basic structure, store architecture, partial components

**Backend:** `app/api/workflows-e/`
- **411 lines** of code
- Services (storage, types), API routes

**Total: 2,626 lines**

**Notes:**
- Smallest implementation (early stage)
- Best planning foundation
- Missing code generator and execution service
- Missing many UI components

## Analysis

### By Total Lines

1. **Workflows D** - 6,273 lines (largest)
2. **Workflows A** - 6,053 lines
3. **Workflows B** - 5,230 lines
4. **Workflows C** - 3,919 lines
5. **Workflows E** - 2,626 lines (smallest)

### By Frontend Lines

1. **Workflows D** - 5,314 lines
2. **Workflows A** - 4,587 lines
3. **Workflows B** - 4,120 lines
4. **Workflows C** - 3,258 lines
5. **Workflows E** - 2,215 lines

### By Backend Lines

1. **Workflows A** - 1,466 lines (includes generator + executor)
2. **Workflows B** - 1,110 lines
3. **Workflows D** - 959 lines
4. **Workflows C** - 661 lines
5. **Workflows E** - 411 lines

## Key Insights

1. **Workflows A has the most backend code** (1,466 lines)
   - Includes code generator (224 lines)
   - Includes execution service (250 lines)
   - Complete storage service

2. **Workflows D has the most frontend code** (5,314 lines)
   - Comprehensive component library
   - Undo/redo implementation
   - Chat panel integration
   - But missing backend services

3. **Workflows E is the smallest** (2,626 total)
   - Early stage implementation
   - Good foundation but needs completion
   - Missing ~3,500 lines to match A's completeness

4. **Workflows C is lean** (3,919 total)
   - Focused on power-user features
   - Less complete than A or D
   - Good for specific features (command palette, code preview)

---

## Migration Impact Estimate

If migrating from A to E:

**To Add:**
- Code generator: ~224 lines
- Execution service: ~250 lines
- UI components: ~2,000-3,000 lines (from A or D)
- **Total to add: ~2,500-3,500 lines**

**Result:**
- Workflows E would grow from **2,626** to **~5,100-6,100 lines**
- Would match or exceed A's size
- But with better architecture and unique features

## Code Distribution

### Workflows A (Most Complete)
```
Frontend: 76% (4,587 / 6,053)
Backend:  24% (1,466 / 6,053)
```

### Workflows B
```
Frontend: 79% (4,120 / 5,230)
Backend:  21% (1,110 / 5,230)
```

### Workflows C
```
Frontend: 83% (3,258 / 3,919)
Backend:  17% (661 / 3,919)
```

### Workflows D (Most Frontend-Heavy)
```
Frontend: 85% (5,314 / 6,273)
Backend:  15% (959 / 6,273)
```

### Workflows E (Most Backend-Light)
```
Frontend: 84% (2,215 / 2,626)
Backend:  16% (411 / 2,626)
```

**Pattern:** All implementations are frontend-heavy (75-85%), which is expected for a visual editor.

---

## Conclusion

**Workflows A** has the best backend-to-frontend balance with complete services.

**Workflows D** has the most frontend code but lacks backend services.

**Workflows E** is the smallest and needs the most work, but has the best foundation.

**Recommendation:** Build on E, migrate services from A (~500 lines), and copy components from A/D (~2,000-3,000 lines).
