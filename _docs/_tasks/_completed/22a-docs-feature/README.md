# Task 21: Docs Feature - Google Docs-Like Product

**Status:** Future
**Created:** December 9, 2025

---

## Overview

A companion to the Records (Sheets) feature - providing a "Docs-like" experience for long-form content, documents, and unstructured knowledge that agents can read, write, and reference.

---

## Placeholder

This task will be planned after Task 20 (Records) is further along.

---

## Initial Thoughts

- Long-form content editing (rich text / markdown)
- Document organization and folders
- Agent reading/writing capabilities
- Potential RAG integration for semantic search
- Version history and collaboration
