# Workflows F - UXD Mockups

This folder contains high-fidelity mockups for Workflows F UI components.

## Mockup Files

- `editor-layout.html` - 3-panel editor layout (chat left, workflow center, settings right)
- `create-workflow-modal.html` - Create workflow modal dialog
- `workflow-list-page.html` - Workflow list page (reference)

## Purpose

Mockups are created **before implementation** to:
- Align on visual design and layout
- Inform implementation decisions
- Ensure consistency with ShadCN design system
- Validate UX flows before coding

## Design System

All mockups should use:
- **ShadCN components** (Button, Card, Dialog, etc.)
- **Minimal custom styling** (polish later)
- **Consistent patterns** with existing codebase
